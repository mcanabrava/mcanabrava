# Hello | Hola | Olá - Welcome to my GitHub page! ✋

## About Me 
I have a degree in Business Administration from UFMG (Federal University of Minas Gerais), frequently positioned as the best business school in Brazil according to several rankings. However, somewhere in the past, I realized a deeper understanding of technology was fundamental to being able to generate more value for the teams I would work with, and decided to create my GitHub to develop some personal projects. 

In addition to being curious and trying out new technologies, I also enjoy disconnecting from screens going out for all kinds of sports practice, and meeting new people.


## Projects 👨‍💻
I intend to use my repository as a way to organize courses and projects I've already taken to help my future self and others. Please find below an index of the most interesting projects on this GitHub.
