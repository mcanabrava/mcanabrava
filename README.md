# Hello | Hola | Olá - Welcome to my github page! ✋

## About Me 
I have a degree in Business Administration from UFMG (Federal University of Minas Gerais), frequently positioned among the best in Brazil in several rankings. 

Despite having started my career in business, in the quest to try to understand how I could help generate more value for society, I realized halfway through that most of the challenges to unlocking the creation of additional value today involve technology somehow.

For this reason, at the end of my graduation, in 2018, I decided to direct my career from business and management consultancy towards technology and started working as a Product Manager in web, data and growth related roles. 

As a curious person, I decided to delve into the alphabet soup of technical terms that I heard every day like HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, Python, CI/CD, staging, deploy, etc and create my own github to develop my projects and immerse more and more in technology. And, in this way, to be able to better contribute to the teams and organizations that I am part of.

In addition to exploring how new technologies work, I also enjoy disconnecting from screens and doing all kinds of sports and meeting new people.


## Projects 👨‍💻
I intend to use my repository as a way to organize courses and projects I've already taken to help my future self and others.

Thus, here you can find basic materials on programming in various topics (HTML, CSS, JS), projects that use AWS and GCP, as well as more advanced content involving Python, SQL and data tools such as dbt, Airflow, more related to my area of interest with data.

Highlights:
1. [AWS Data Engineering ETL project using a 11GB dataset, S3, SQS, Lambda, Firehose, Glue and Athena transforming data from CSV to JSON to Parquet so it can be queried using SQL](https://github.com/mcanabrava/data-engineering-aws-mba-fiap)
2. [AWS Data Engineering data modelling and ETL project ingesting multiple JSON files from S3 into Redshift staging and analytical tables using Python Boto3 SDK](https://github.com/mcanabrava/udacity-aws-data-engineering-nanodegree/tree/main/2.%20Cloud%20Data%20Warehouses)
3. [Data Pipelines with Airflow, S3 and Redshift](https://github.com/mcanabrava/udacity-aws-data-engineering-nanodegree/tree/main/4.%20Data%20Pipelines%20with%20Airflow)
